Will's Lamb chops with sauteed potatoes

Recipe for 1. Scale up as necessary.

Ingredients
-----------

Boneless Lamb chop
Lamb stock cube
Olive oil
Butter
Mint Sauce
Greek yoghurt
Medium potato
Garlic
Thyme
Salt
Pepper
Mixed Salad leaves
Cherry tomatos
Balsamic Vinegar

Pre-preparation
---------------

Marinade your lamb chop(s) in advance. 24 hours is great. 
To make the marinade, mix one lamb stock cube, a pinch of thyme and a generous spoonful of
mint sauce with olive oil. Rub the mixture into the lamb, and leave in 
a covered bowl in the fridge.

Preparation
-----------

Chop the potato into small (1-2cm) cubes.

Roughly chop two cloves of garlic.

Mix greek yoghurt and mint sauce 3:1 to create mint yoghurt.

Method
------

Place the chopped potato in a pan of boiling water to parboil and set a timer for 5 minutes.

After 5 minutes have elapsed, heat up some olive oil in a medium griddle pan, and some butter
in a frying pan.

When the pans have heated up, place the lamb chops in the griddle pan, approx 6 minutes per side.

Strain the potato, and add to the buttered frying pan, along with the garlic, thyme, salt and pepper.

After 10-12 minutes, when the potato has gone brown and crispy, take it off the heat.

Slice some cherry tomatoes into quarters, and plate it up with mixed salad leaves and balsamic vinegar.

Plate up the potato and the cooked lamb chops. Drizzle some minted yoghurt over the lamb.
