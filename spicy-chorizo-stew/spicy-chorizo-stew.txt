Ingredients
-----------

1x 	Whole Chorizo (LIDL)
2x 	Tinned Plum Tomatoes
1x 	Tinned Kidney Beans
1x 	Tinned Butter Beans
half	Large sweet potato (or 1 small)
1x	Large onion
half	Garlic Bulb (~6 cloves)

Smokey Chipotle Chilli paste (Tesco)
Chilli powder
Smoked paprika
Cumin
Black pepper
Honey
Rapeseed oil
Beef stock cube

Preparation
-----------

Finely chop the onion and garlic.

Cut the sweet potato into 1-2cm cubes.

Cut the entire chorizo into thin slices, or chunks. Whichever you prefer.

Method
------

Place 1 tbsp rapeseed oil into a large saucepan, and heat it up. Add the onion and garlic, to soften. They should not brown.

Meanwhile, start parboiling the sweet potato cubes.

When the onion and garlic have softened and gone translucent, stir in the diced chorizo.

Wait until the sweet potato cubes are soft enough to be edible, but still slightly unpleasantly crunchy.
Save the water they have been parboiled in. Add the cubes to the saucepan and stir occasionally.

Top up or pour away the sweet potato water to get to around 450ml. Dissolve a beef stock cube in the water.

Add the resulting stock to the saucepan. Bring it up to a simmer, put the lid on, reduce the heat and leave it for 10 minutes.

Add the 2 tins of plum tomatoes, 2 generous tsps of chipotle paste, 1 tsp Cumin, 1 tsp Honey, 1 tsp chilli powder, 
a grind of black pepper and 1 tbsp of Smoked paprika (yes tablespoon). Stir this in. Bring it up to a simmer again,
put the lid on and leave it for 10 minutes.

Rinse the kidney beans and butter beans. Add both lots of beans to the saucepan, cover and leave for 10 minutes. If the balance
of spice is not quite right, tinker now.

	Not smokey enough	Add smoked paprika or chipotle paste
	Not spicy enough	Add chipotle paste

Take the stew off the heat and let it rest for a further 10 minutes before serving.
